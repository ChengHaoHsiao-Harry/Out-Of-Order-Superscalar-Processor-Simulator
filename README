1. Type "make" to build.  (Type "make clean" first if you already compiled and want to recompile from scratch.)

2. Run trace reader:

   To run without throttling output:
   ./sim 256 32 4 gcc_trace.txt

   To run with throttling (via "less"):
   ./sim 256 32 4 gcc_trace.txt | less







   === for debug ===
   ./sim 8 3 1 gcc_trace.txt

   ./sim 16 8 1 val_trace_gcc1 > harrydebug.txt

   === for debug(enough IQ and ROB size)
   val1.txt command(short version)
